Here are **10 more fresh JavaScript problem ideas** for beginners:

1. **Convert a Number to Roman Numerals**

   - Write a function that converts a given number to its Roman numeral representation (e.g., `4` → `IV`, `12` → `XII`).

2. **Count the Number of Divisors of a Number**

   - Create a program that calculates how many divisors a given number has (e.g., `12` → `6` because divisors are `1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12`).

3. **Find All Prime Numbers in a Range**

   - Write a function to find all prime numbers between two given numbers (e.g., between `10` and `20` → `[11, 13, 17, 19]`).

4. **Group Words by Their Length**

   - Create a program that groups words in a sentence by their length (e.g., `"I love programming"` → `{1: ["I"], 4: ["love"], 11: ["programming"]}`).

5. **Find the Sum of Two Closest Numbers in an Array**

   - Write a function to find two numbers in an array whose sum is closest to a target value (e.g., `[2, 4, 7, 10]` and target `15` → `7 + 10 = 17`).

6. **Check if a String is Made of Unique Characters**

   - Build a program to check if a string contains only unique characters (e.g., `"hello"` → `false`, `"world"` → `true`).

7. **Sort an Array of Objects by a Property**

   - Write a program that sorts an array of objects by a specific property (e.g., sorting an array of users by age).

8. **Calculate the Digital Root of a Number**

   - Create a function that repeatedly sums the digits of a number until a single-digit number is obtained (e.g., `942` → `9 + 4 + 2 = 15 → 1 + 5 = 6`).

9. **Find the Difference Between Two Arrays**

   - Write a function to return the elements that are unique to each of two arrays (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]` and `[2, 3, 4]` → `[1, 4]`).

10. **Convert Time from 12-hour to 24-hour Format**

- Build a program to convert time given in 12-hour format to 24-hour format (e.g., `02:30 PM` → `14:30`).

These problems cover intermediate concepts like working with objects, algorithms, and mathematical logic while still being approachable for beginners. Let me know if you'd like further guidance!
