      "What is the difference between relative and absolute positioning in CSS?",
    answer:

  },
  {
    question: "What are pseudo-classes in CSS?",
    answer:
      "Pseudo-classes define the special state of an element, such as `:hover` for when a user hovers over an element, or `:nth-child()` for selecting specific children of an element.",
  },

  {
    question: "What is the purpose of the z-index property?",
    answer:
      "The `z-index` property specifies the stack order of elements. Higher values are displayed in front of lower values. It only works on elements with a position value other than `static`.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What is the difference between `em`, `rem`, and `px` units in CSS?",
    answer:
      "`px` is an absolute unit representing pixels. `em` is a relative unit based on the font-size of the parent element. `rem` is a relative unit based on the font-size of the root element (usually `<html>`).",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you center a div horizontally and vertically?",
    answer:
      "One way to center a div is using Flexbox: `display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;`. Another way is using `position: absolute;` with `top: 50%; left: 50%; transform: translate(-50%, -50%);`.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between CSS Grid and Flexbox?",

  },
  {
    question:
      "What is the difference between `visibility: hidden` and `display: none`?",
    answer:
      "`visibility: hidden` hides the element but still takes up space in the layout. `display: none` removes the element from the layout, so it doesnâ€™t take up any space.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are media queries in CSS?",
    answer:
      "Media queries are used to apply styles based on device characteristics, such as screen width, height, resolution, or orientation. Example: `@media (max-width: 600px) { body { background-color: lightgray; } }`.",
