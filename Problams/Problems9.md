Here are **20 more JavaScript problem ideas** for beginners:

### **Array and String Problems**

1. **Remove All Vowels from a String**

   - Write a program to remove all vowels from a given string (e.g., `"hello world"` → `"hll wrld"`).

2. **Reverse Words in a Sentence**

   - Create a function that reverses the order of words in a sentence (e.g., `"Hello world"` → `"world Hello"`).

3. **Find the Most Frequent Character in a String**

   - Write a function to determine the character that appears most frequently in a string (e.g., `"javascript"` → `a`).

4. **Rotate Characters in a String**

   - Build a program to rotate the characters of a string by a given number of positions (e.g., `"abcdef"` rotated by 2 → `"efabcd"`).

5. **Check for Palindromic Substrings**

   - Find all substrings in a string that are palindromes (e.g., `"abcba"` → `["bcb", "abcba"]`).

6. **Find Duplicate Characters in a String**

   - Create a function to find all duplicate characters in a string (e.g., `"programming"` → `["r", "g", "m"]`).

7. **Replace Spaces with Dashes**

   - Write a function to replace all spaces in a string with dashes (e.g., `"hello world"` → `"hello-world"`).

8. **Find Longest Increasing Subsequence in an Array**

   - Given an array of numbers, find the longest increasing subsequence (e.g., `[3, 10, 2, 1, 20]` → `[3, 10, 20]`).

9. **Merge Two Sorted Arrays**

   - Write a program to merge two sorted arrays into one sorted array (e.g., `[1, 3, 5]` and `[2, 4, 6]` → `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`).

10. **Filter Array by Condition**

- Create a program to filter an array based on a condition (e.g., keep only numbers greater than `5`: `[2, 6, 8]` → `[6, 8]`).

### **Math and Number Problems**

11. **Convert a Number to Words**

- Write a program to convert a number to its word representation (e.g., `123` → `"one hundred twenty-three"`).

12. **Find Perfect Numbers**

- Create a function to determine if a number is perfect (a number equal to the sum of its divisors, excluding itself, e.g., `6` → `true`).

13. **Check if a Number is Happy**

- Write a program to check if a number is a "happy number" (e.g., repeatedly sum the squares of its digits until you reach `1` → `19` → `1² + 9² = 82 → 8² + 2² = 68 → ... → `1`).

14. **Find Nth Fibonacci Number**

- Build a function to find the Nth Fibonacci number using recursion.

15. **Count Trailing Zeroes in Factorial**

- Write a function to count the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of a number (e.g., `5! = 120` → `1` trailing zero).

16. **Check for Perfect Squares in a Range**

- Create a program to find all perfect square numbers in a given range.

17. **Generate Random OTP**

- Write a function to generate a 6-digit random OTP (One-Time Password).

18. **Check if a Number is a Power of Two**

- Build a function to check if a given number is a power of two (e.g., `16` → `true`, `18` → `false`).

19. **Calculate the Sum of Prime Numbers**

- Write a program to calculate the sum of all prime numbers less than a given number.

20. **Find the Closest Pair in an Array**

- Given an array of numbers, find the pair of elements with the smallest difference.
