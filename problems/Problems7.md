Here are **10 more JavaScript problem ideas** for beginners:

1. **Find the Sum of Odd and Even Numbers Separately**

   - Write a program that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of odd and even numbers separately (e.g., `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` → `oddSum: 9`, `evenSum: 6`).

2. **Convert a String to Title Case**

   - Create a function that capitalizes the first letter of every word in a string (e.g., `"hello world"` → `"Hello World"`).

3. **Check if Two Strings are Permutations of Each Other**

   - Write a function to check if two strings are permutations of each other (e.g., `"abc"` and `"cab"` → `true`).

4. **Calculate the Product of an Array (Ignoring Zero)**

   - Build a function that calculates the product of all non-zero elements in an array (e.g., `[1, 2, 0, 4]` → `8`).

5. **Count Unique Values in an Array**

   - Write a program to count the number of unique values in an array (e.g., `[1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4]` → `4`).

6. **Find All Substrings of a String**

   - Create a function to generate all substrings of a given string (e.g., `"abc"` → `["a", "ab", "abc", "b", "bc", "c"]`).

7. **Simulate a Simple ATM Withdrawal**

   - Build a program that simulates an ATM. It should take an input amount and return the number of bills (e.g., for $150, return `1x100, 1x50`).

8. **Find the Majority Element in an Array**

   - Write a function to find the element that appears more than half the time in an array, if it exists (e.g., `[3, 3, 4, 3, 5, 3]` → `3`).

9. **Shuffle an Array**

   - Create a program that shuffles an array randomly (e.g., `[1, 2, 3, 4]` → `[3, 1, 4, 2]`).

10. **Check if an Array is a Subsequence of Another**

- Write a function to check if one array is a subsequence of another (e.g., `[1, 3, 5]` is a subsequence of `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`).

These problems cover a broad range of JavaScript concepts, from strings and arrays to logical algorithms. Let me know if you’d like even more challenges or help with solving them!
