Here are **10 additional unique JavaScript problem ideas** for beginners:

1. **Convert Decimal to Binary**

   - Write a function that converts a decimal number to its binary equivalent (e.g., `10` → `1010`).

2. **Find the Sum of Multiples**

   - Create a program to find the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below a given number (e.g., below `10`: `3 + 5 + 6 + 9 = 23`).

3. **Find the Smallest Missing Positive Number**

   - Given an array of positive integers, find the smallest missing positive number (e.g., `[1, 2, 4]` → `3`).

4. **Rotate an Array**

   - Write a program to rotate an array to the right by a given number of steps (e.g., `[1, 2, 3, 4]` rotated 2 steps → `[3, 4, 1, 2]`).

5. **Check if a Year is a Leap Year**

   - Build a function to determine if a given year is a leap year.

6. **Count Occurrences of a Word in a String**

   - Write a program to count how many times a specific word appears in a given string.

7. **Find the Median of an Array**

   - Create a function to calculate the median of an array of numbers.

8. **Remove All Spaces from a String**

   - Build a function that removes all spaces from a given string (e.g., `"Hello World"` → `"HelloWorld"`).

9. **Find the First Non-Repeating Character**

   - Write a program to find the first character in a string that does not repeat (e.g., `"swiss"` → `"w"`).

10. **Sum of Numbers in a Range**

- Create a function to calculate the sum of all integers between two numbers, inclusive (e.g., sum between `1` and `5` → `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15`).
