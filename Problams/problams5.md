Here are **10 more JavaScript problem ideas** for beginners:

1. **Replace All Vowels in a String**

   - Write a program to replace all vowels in a string with a specified character (e.g., `"hello"` → `"h*ll*"` if `*` is the replacement).

2. **Sort Words Alphabetically**

   - Create a program to sort the words in a given sentence alphabetically.

3. **Sum of Squares**

   - Write a function to calculate the sum of squares of all numbers in an array (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]` → `1² + 2² + 3² = 14`).

4. **Find the Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**

   - Create a program to find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters (e.g., `"abcabcbb"` → `3` for `"abc"`).

5. **Find Common Divisors**

   - Write a program to find all common divisors of two numbers (e.g., `12` and `18` → `[1, 2, 3, 6]`).

6. **Check if a String is a Pangram**

   - Build a function to check if a given string contains every letter of the alphabet at least once (e.g., `"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"` → `true`).

7. **Generate Multiplication Table**

   - Create a program to generate a multiplication table for a given number.

8. **Find the Mode of an Array**

   - Write a function to find the mode (most frequently occurring value) in an array.

9. **Check if Two Strings are Rotations**

   - Build a function to check if one string is a rotation of another (e.g., `"abcde"` and `"deabc"` → `true`).

10. **Check if a Number is a Perfect Square**

- Write a program to check if a given number is a perfect square (e.g., `16` → `true`, `18` → `false`).

These problems provide more variety, covering strings, arrays, numbers, and logical challenges. Let me know if you'd like even more ideas or solutions!
