21. Find the longest word in a sentence.
22. Calculate the sum of all numeric values in a nested object.
23. Implement a memoization function to cache results of expensive computations.
24. Sort an array of objects by a specific property (e.g., `age` in ascending order).
25. Create a custom event emitter class with `on()` and `emit()` methods.
26. Convert a CSV string into an array of objects (headers as keys).
27. Implement a binary search algorithm for a sorted array.
28. Write a function to deep clone an object (handle nested objects and arrays).
29. Simulate a dice roll until a 6 is rolled, using promises and recursion.
30. Throttle API calls to ensure they execute at most once every 2 seconds.
31. Check if a string has balanced parentheses (e.g., `"((()))"` is valid).
