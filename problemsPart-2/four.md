### **Core JavaScript & Algorithms**

1. Implement a function to check if a string is a valid parentheses sequence (including `{}`, `[]`, and `()`).
2. Write a function to find the **most frequent element** in an array.
3. Create a function to calculate the **nth Fibonacci number** using memoization.
4. Rotate a matrix (2D array) by 90 degrees clockwise in place.
5. Check if a string is a **pangram** (contains every letter of the alphabet).
6. Implement a **linked list** with methods to add, remove, and search nodes.
7. Find the **longest common prefix** among an array of strings.
8. Calculate the **median** of an unsorted array of numbers.
9. Simulate a **stack** data structure using only queues.
10. Reverse words in a sentence without reversing the entire string (e.g., `"hello world"` → `"world hello"`).

### **DOM & Browser APIs**

11. Create a **drag-and-drop** interface for reordering list items.
12. Build a **search bar** with real-time suggestions using debounced API calls.
13. Use the **Intersection Observer API** to lazy-load images as they scroll into view.
14. Implement a **video player** with custom controls (play, pause, volume).
15. Detect when the user **resizes the window** and adjust layout elements dynamically.
16. Create a **custom modal/dialog** that traps keyboard focus.
17. Build a **progress bar** that updates based on scroll position.
18. Use the **Clipboard API** to copy text to the clipboard on button click.
19. Implement a **file uploader** with previews for images and PDFs.
20. Create a **collapsible accordion** component with smooth animations.

### **Async & Functional Programming**

21. Implement a **retry mechanism** for failed API calls (max 3 attempts).
22. Write a **throttle function** that executes at most once every `n` seconds.
23. Use `Promise.allSettled` to log results of multiple API calls regardless of success/failure.
24. Create a **polling system** that fetches data every 5 seconds until a condition is met.
25. Simulate a **race condition** between two promises and handle resolution/cancellation.
26. Chain promises dynamically based on user input (e.g., sequential API calls).
27. Use `async/await` to read and process a local JSON file in a browser environment.
28. Implement a **pipe function** to compose multiple functions (e.g., `pipe(f, g)(x) = g(f(x))`).
29. Write a **curried version** of a function that adds three numbers (e.g., `add(1)(2)(3)`).
30. Create a **generator function** to yield prime numbers indefinitely.

### **Advanced Concepts**

31. Use a `Proxy` to create an object with **read-only properties**.
32. Implement **inheritance** using ES6 classes and the `extends` keyword.
33. Write a function to detect **circular references** in an object.
34. Create a **singleton pattern** using closures or ES6 modules.
35. Polyfill `Array.prototype.filter()` for older browsers.
36. Use `Object.defineProperty` to create a reactive property that triggers a callback on change.
37. Implement a **custom event loop** using `setTimeout` to simulate microtasks/macrotasks.
38. Parse a URL query string into an object (e.g., `?name=John&age=30` → `{ name: "John", age: "30" }`).
39. Create a **Web Worker** to calculate factorial of large numbers without blocking the UI thread.
40. Use `WeakMap` to create private properties in a class.

### **Practical Applications**

41. Build a **form validator** with real-time feedback for email, password, and phone fields.
42. Create a **multi-step wizard** form with a progress indicator.
43. Implement a **client-side router** using `window.location` and the History API.
44. Write a script to **highlight text** on a page based on a search query.
45. Build a **todo list** with CRUD operations and localStorage persistence.
46. Create a **bar chart** from an array of data using the Canvas API.
47. Use the **SpeechSynthesis API** to convert text to speech on button click.
48. Implement a **dark mode toggle** that persists across page reloads.
49. Simulate a **chat application** with message timestamps and auto-scroll to new messages.
50. Write a **JWT decoder** to parse and validate a JSON Web Token’s payload.
